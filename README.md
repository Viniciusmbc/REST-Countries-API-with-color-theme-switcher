Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Remix](https://remix.run/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned to use search queries, routes params, use the form, routes and other things from remix-run.

### Useful resources

- [Routes params](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/data-loading) -This documentation helped me understand the use of search params in the remix. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
